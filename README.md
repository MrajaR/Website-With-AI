# My First Project: Chatbot NLP Model and Pose Estimation with Mediapipe

## Introduction

Welcome to my first-ever project! In this repository, I've developed a Chatbot NLP model and implemented pose estimation using Mediapipe. The project also includes a web application using Flask to deploy these functionalities. I'm excited to share my journey of building this project from scratch and achieving my goals.

## Project Overview

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. **Chatbot NLP Model:** The Chatbot NLP model is designed to provide health and fitness consultations. Users can interact with the chatbot to get personalized advice, guidance, and tips for their fitness journey.

2. **Pose Estimation with Mediapipe:** The pose estimation feature utilizes Mediapipe to monitor squat, push-up, and sit-up exercises. Users can receive real-time feedback on their exercise form, making it an excellent tool for fitness enthusiasts and beginners alike.

## Dataset Creation

One of the challenging aspects of this project was creating the dataset from scratch. I meticulously collected and annotated data to train the Chatbot NLP model and the pose estimation model effectively. Though it might not be perfect, the experience of curating my own dataset has been immensely valuable for my learning journey.

## Technologies Used

The project involves the following technologies:

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** I leveraged NLP techniques to build the chatbot model, enabling it to understand and respond to user queries effectively.

- **Mediapipe:** Mediapipe provided the backbone for implementing pose estimation. It allowed me to track and analyze key points in the human body during exercises.

- **Flask Web Framework:** I used Flask to create a web application and deploy the chatbot and pose estimation features seamlessly.

## How to Use the Project

To run the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required dependencies by running: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Launch the Flask web application by running: `python app.py`

4. Access the web application through your browser and interact with the chatbot for health and fitness consultations.

5. To use the pose estimation feature, follow the on-screen instructions and perform squat, push-up, or sit-up exercises in front of your camera.

## Contribution and Future Improvements

I recognize that there's always room for improvement, and I welcome contributions, suggestions, and feedback from the community. If you encounter any issues or have ideas for enhancements, please feel free to create a pull request or raise an issue.

In the future, I plan to enhance the chatbot's capabilities, optimize the pose estimation model, and explore other exciting features to make this project even more valuable for users.

## Acknowledgments

I want to express my gratitude to all the online tutorials, documentation, and forums that helped me learn and grow as a developer throughout this project.

Thank you for checking out my first-ever project! I hope you find it interesting and useful.
